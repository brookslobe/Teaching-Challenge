This repository contains starter and complete code for creating a canvas-based platformer game using the Phaser library

The Complete folder contains the code necessary for a sidescrolling platformer game that I created after modifying and adding to existing Phaser example code.

The Starter folder is near identical to the Complete folder, there is no app.js (complete) javascript file.  Instead, there is a starter.js and a learn.js.

The learn.js file is for you to follow along with my teaching video to eventually match the content found in the app.js file found in the complete folder.

My advice would be to leave the starter.js file alone so that you have a backup of the original code in case you run into a bug when coding.

You will need to be running a localhost server in order for these canvas-based games to run.

Have fun learning some basics of the Phaser library!
